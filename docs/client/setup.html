      <h2>Downloading</h2>
      <p>
        Head over to the <a href="/download">download</a> page and download the
        latest version of the client software for your operating system. You can
        also download the python script directly from github if you prefer, but
        make sure to recursively clone it and pip install the requirements if
        you go that route!
      </p>

        <p>Important note:</p>
        <p>
          If you use Linux and are using a binary from the Downloads page, note
          that you will have to mark it as executable by using chmod +x filename

      <h2>Starting the client</h2>
      <div class="autosizemiddle">
        <p>Important note:</p>
        <p>
          If you are using Windows, you will need to ensure you are using a
          compatible console. The standard Command Prompt and Powershell
          terminals provided by Windows are not suitable due to a lack of
          support for many standardised escape codes.

            >Windows Terminal</a
          >
          (Microsoft Store link) does support these codes, and is the
          recommended terminal app for end users.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are using an executable from the download page, you will also
          need to set it as your default terminal app.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Windows:</h3>
      <p>
        If it's an executable from the download page, just double click it to
        open! If it's a script file, you'll need to open it from your terminal
        by running python3 client.py
      </p>
      <h3>MacOS and Linux</h3>
      <p>
        Open your chosen terminal app and run the app using it. This is often as
        easy as dragging the executable into the windows and hitting enter.

      <h2>Connecting to a server</h2>
      <p>
        Each time you start the client you will be asked to input a server
        address.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not know what server to join, feel free to join the official
        server at relink.network. Know that due to federation, which server you
        join does not really matter, as, just like email, you can join any
        channel and DM any user from any server.
      </p>
      <p>... and that's it!</p>
